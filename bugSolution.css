One approach to handle potential inconsistencies with `calc()` is to avoid mixing units excessively, particularly when working with percentages and viewport-relative units (`vh`, `vw`).  Instead, consider using a more straightforward calculation method that relies less on unit conversions within `calc()`. If highly precise calculations are needed, you might need to perform calculations on the client-side using JavaScript to accurately determine the desired element dimensions based on the viewport or parent element sizes.

Another possible solution is to use CSS variables (`--custom-width`, for example) to store intermediate calculation results, making the code easier to read and maintain. This can also simplify debugging.

```css
:root {
  --container-width: 50%;
}

.container {
  width: var(--container-width);
}

.element {
  width: calc(var(--container-width) + 10px);
}
```
This avoids potential calculation errors resulting from complex expressions within `calc()`.
